# Utility

Utility is a package of commonly used classes and interfaces that support other systems
of Fast Unity Creation Kit. It contains quite a bunch of other subsystems that can manage
object properties like initialization state, name, description, icons, prefabs, etc.

The subsystems of the Utility system are:
* [Initialization](SystemCoreInitialization.md) - The initialization system is used to manage the initialization of objects in the game.
* [Properties](SystemCoreUtilityProperties.md) - The properties system is used to manage the properties of objects in the game.
* [Singleton](SystemCoreSingleton.md) - The singleton system is used to manage the singleton objects in the game. It is used to create
  singleton objects that can be accessed from anywhere in the game.
